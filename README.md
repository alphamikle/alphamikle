## Hi there üëã


### About me
My name is Mike Alfa. I'm a passionate Software Engineer in love with Flutter. Also, I own several other technologies - JS/TS (the last is preferable to JS), Node.js, React, and much different staff.


### My Projects
I own a few Open Source projects for Flutter and Node.js and am the creator of Nanc CMS - next-gen CMS for Flutter apps and any other app, site, or anything else, allowing you to update your app, made with Flutter, without republishing on the AppStore or Google Play. For now, it is in a public technical demo now.

### Contribution
I wrote many articles about themes - Flutter, Mobile Development, Node, Web Development, Software Engineering in general, Open Source, and many others. In addition - I'm an active judge in several international hackathons and an online teacher on educational platforms. Webinars creator and presenter. Many hundreds of thousands (or maybe millions) of developers around the world have learned about my experience, development and research! I love giving interviews and answering difficult technical questions. And, of course, I love my wife and my beautiful little daughter üòç

### Work Projects
My contribution to Software Engineering is significant - I created several cool applications, sites, and services with dozens of millions of users. With great teams and solo (very rarely), from scratch, and continued someone else's work.

Here is some of the latest:

### [Hire me!](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alphamikle/)
I am now actively seeking new challenges, ready to contribute incredibly to your product and team. I would love to make your company better and would be glad to surprise you with my abilities and skills.

But there are two "but"s:
1. For now I'm only interested in Flutter - I bet on this technology a long time ago, and I've only seen how right it was since then. I'm sure Flutter will take over the world, and sooner or later, "everything will be the Widget".
2. I am only interested in working for American companies. No others I consider.

If this is not a "but" for you but a "buzz" - we are on our way. [Write to me](mailto:alphamikle@gmail.com?subject=We%20want%20to%20hire%20you%2C%20Mike%21). I hope we will become colleagues!
